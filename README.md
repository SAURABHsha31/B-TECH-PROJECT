# B-TECH-PROJECT
In this project, at first, the analysis of dynamics of model is done using qualitative property of differential equations.
Then the numerical analysis and validation is done using MATLAB. 
For the bridging of both analyses, the Mathematica software is used.
In this way, the analysis of the proposed model consisting target and attacker 
sides with different compartments is done.
